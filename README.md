# Getting-into-git

## Moment number one
This repository contains files instead of the 9 lectures originally requested, I have added 9 homework assignments. 
I do not have access to the lecture materials, so I created the homework assignments to demonstrate my understanding of the course content.

## Moment number two
Regarding the fourth point of the homework assignment, specifically: "Create an arbitrary HTML file where 2 forms from the previous lecture will be styled using Bootstrap", I would like to inform you that I do not have access to the lectures you would like to see the styling with Bootstrap. Instead, I have created two forms myself - a Login Form and a Registration Form - with styling using Bootstrap.
